SQL Issues
** MYSQL Database on XAMMP is not running -> 
tail -50 /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/var/mysql/Michaels-MacBook-Pro.local.err

if the error says "Can't lock aria control file... file is probably in use by another process"
This means there's a zombie MySQL process still running that's blocking the new one from starting.->
ps aux | grep mysql
sudo kill -9 [PID_NUMBER]

or

sudo killall mysqld
